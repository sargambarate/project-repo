                    <h2><u>Steps</u>:-</h2><br/>
                    1. You will need one head of cauliflower.I like my florets a little chunkier, so they aren't just mush after cooking.<br/>
                    2. Cut, wash and set aside.<br/>
                    3. Finely chop onions and tomatoes. Chop 1 green serrano chili (optional).<br/> 
                    4. Make rough paste of garlic and ginger.I use plenty of these two to get that Indian flavor going. I like my mortar and pestle to make this rough paste.<br/>
                    5. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat and when it's hot add a few whole black peppers, cloves and small chunks of cinnamon, along with few cumin seeds (jeera).<br/> 
                    6. Sauté these spices for a few seconds. We do this just to get the aromas and flavors from the whole spices. Remember, we don't eat these, except for the cumin seeds. You might take them out before serving your guests.<br/>
                    7. Add your chopped onions and sauté until golden brown. Add tomatoes and green chilies, salt to taste.<br/> 
                    8. Now in goes your spice powders; turmeric, red chili powder and coriander powder. Stir and cook for a few minutes.<br/> 
                    9. Add ginger and garlic paste and stir this mixture until everything is well combined.<br/> 
                    10. Keep on stirring until you end up with a nice sauce and the tomatoes break down and oil starts separating a little from this mixture. This process should not take more than 10 minutes.<br/>
                    11. Now it's time to add those cauliflower florets and stir well. Put your stove to medium low, cover and cook for 5 minutes.<br/> 
                    12. You can add 1/2 cup of water if your mixture starts sticking to bottom.<br/> 
                    13. When the cauliflower is getting tender, you can add the frozen peas. If you are using fresh peas, you need to add them tad bit earlier, as they need to cook too.<br/>
                    14. And that's it. When your vegetables are cooked, garnish with chopped cilantro and serve it up.<br/>
